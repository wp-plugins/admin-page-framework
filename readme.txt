Provides simpler means of building administration pages for plugin and theme developers. 

== Description ==
It provides plugin and theme developers with easier means of creating option pages. Extend the library class and pass your arrays that define the form elements to the predefined class methods. The library handles all the complex coding behind the scene and creates the pages and the forms for you. The package includes a demo plugin which helps you walk through necessary features.

**Notes:** this framework does not do anything by itself. If you are not a developer, you do not need this.

= Features =
* **Root Page, Sub Pages, and Tabs** - it allows you to instantly create a top level page and the sub pages of it, plus tabs inside the sub pages.
* **Extensible** - the created admin pages will become highly extensible with the automatically created hooks. In other words, it empowers other developers to customize your plugin or theme. That will result on making your projects grow.
* **Import and Export Options** - buttons that the user can import and export settings by uploading and downloading the text file.
* **Image Upload** - it lets the user easily upload images to the site or the user can choose from existent urls or already uploaded files.
* **Color Picker** - it lets the user easily pick colors.
* **Rich Text Editor** - supports the rich text editor form input.
* **Reset Button** - create a reset button that lets your users to initialize the saved options.
* **Settings API Implemented** - it uses the [WordPress Settings API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_API) for creating the form so the standard option design will be employed.
* **Validation and Error Messages** - with the pre-defined validation callbacks, the user's submitting data can be verified as a part of using the Settings API. Furthermore, by setting the error array, you can display the error message to the user.
* **Custom Post Types** - the framework provides methods to create custom post types.
* **Meta Boxes** - the framework provides methods to create custom meta boxes with form elements that you define.
* **Contextual Help Tabs** - the contextual help pane can be easily added. 
* **Custom Field Types** - your own field type can be registered. 

= Built-in Field Types =
* `text` - a normal input field.
* `password` - a masked input field.
* `textarea` - a text input field with multiple lines.
* `radio` - a set of radio buttons.
* `checkbox` - a check box.
* `select` - a dropdown list.
* `submit` - a submit field that the user  
* `hidden` - a hidden field that is useful to embed hidden values. 
* `file` - a file field that lets the user upload files.
* `media` - a custom text field with the media uploader that sets the file URL.
* `image` - a custom text field with the image uploader that sets the image URL.
* `color` - a custom text field with the color picker.
* `export` - a custom submit field that lets the user export the settings. 
* `import` - a combination field of the file and the submit fields that lets the user import the settings.
* `posttype` - a check-list of post types enabled on the site.
* `taxonomy` - check-lists of taxonomies enabled on the site in a tabbed box.
* `size` - a combination field of the text and the select fields that let the user set sizes with a unit.

= Custom Field Types = 
You can include your own custom field types when they are necessary. This enables to keep the main library file to be minimum as possible. The sample custom field types are included in the demo plugin.

* `geometry` - a location selector with the Google map.
* `date`, `time`, `date_time` - date and time fields with the date picker.
* `dial` - a dial input field.
* `font` - a font uploader and its preview.

= Necessary Files =
* **`admin-page-framework.php`** is in the *class* folder.

== Installation ==

= Getting Started =

<h5><strong>Step 1</strong> - Include <em><strong>admin-page-framework.php</strong></em></h5>
You need to include the library file in your PHP script. The file is located in the `class` folder of the uncompressed plugin file.

`if ( ! class_exists( 'AdminPageFramework' ) )
    include_once( dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/class/admin-page-framework.php' );`
	
<h5><strong>Step 2</strong> - Extend the Library Class</h5>

`class APF_GettingStarted extends AdminPageFramework {
}`

<h5><strong>Step 3</strong> - Define the <em>setUp()</em> Method</h5>

`function setUp() {
	$this->setRootMenuPage( 'Settings' );               // specifies to which parent menu to belong.
	$this->addSubMenuPage(
		'My First Page',    // page and menu title
		'myfirstpage' 	// page slug
	); 
}`

<h5><strong>Step 4</strong> - Define the Methods for Hooks</h5>

`function do_myfirstpage() {  // do_ + pageslug	
	?>
	<h3>Say Something</h3>
	<p>This is my first admin page!</p>
	<?php
}`

<h5><strong>Step 5</strong> - Instantiate the Class</h5>

`new APF_GettingStarted;`

= Example Code = 

`<?php
/* Plugin Name: Admin Page Framework - Getting Started */ 

if ( ! class_exists( 'AdminPageFramework' ) )
    include_once( dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/class/admin-page-framework.php' );
    
class APF extends AdminPageFramework {

    function setUp() {
		
    	$this->setRootMenuPage( 'Settings' );	
		$this->addSubMenuPage(
			'My First Page',	// page and menu title
			'myfirstpage'		// page slug
		);
	
    }

    function do_myfirstpage() {  // do_ + pageslug
        ?>
        <h3>Say Something</h3>
        <p>This is my first admin page!</p>
        <?php   
    }
    
}
new APF;
// That's it!`

== Frequently asked questions ==
= What is this for? =
This is	a PHP class library that enables to create option pages and form fields in the administration panel. Also it helps manage to save, export, and import options.

= I've written a useful class, functions, and even custom field types that will be useful for others! Do you want to include it? = 
The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/michaeluno/admin-page-framework "Admin Page Framework") is avaiable. Raise an [issue](https://github.com/michaeluno/admin-page-framework/issues) first and we'll see if changes can be made. 

= How can I contribute to improving the documentation? =
You are welcome to submit documentation. Please follow the [Documentation Guidline](https://github.com/michaeluno/admin-page-framework/blob/master/documentation_guideline.md). 

In addition, your tutorials and snippets for the framework can be listed in the manual. Let us know it [here](https://github.com/michaeluno/admin-page-framework/issues?direction=desc&labels=Documentation&page=1&sort=created&state=open).

== Other Notes ==

= Tips =
<h5><strong>Use Unique Page Slug</strong></h5>
The framework internally uses the `add_submenu_page()` function to register sub menu pages. When the same page slug is registered for multiple root pages, only the last registered callback gets triggered. The other ones will be ignored.

This means if you choose a very simple page slug such as <code>about</code> for your plugin/theme's information page and then if there is another plugin using same page slug, your users will get either of your page or the other.

So just use a unique page slug. One way to do that is to add a prefix like <code>apf_about</code>. 

<h5><strong>Change Class Names</strong></h5>
When you include the library, change the class names that the library uses. This is because if there is a plugin that uses a lesser version of the library and it is loaded earlier than yours, your script may not work properly.

All the class names have the prefix <code>AdminPageFramework</code> so just change it to something like <code>MyPlugin_AdminPageFramework</code>. 

Most text editors supports the *Replace All* command so just use that. By the time WordPress's minimum required PHP version becomes 5.3 or higher, we can use namespaces then this problem will be solved.

<h5><strong>Change Framework's System Messages</strong></h5>
The default messages defined by the framework can be changed. For example when you import a setting with the framework, the setting notice will be displayed. 

If you want to change it to something else, modify the `oMsg` object. It has the `arrMessages` public property array which holds all the messages that the library uses.

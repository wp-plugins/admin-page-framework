Provides simpler means of building administration pages for plugin and theme developers. 

== Description ==
It provides plugin and theme developers with easier means of creating option pages. Extend the library class and pass your arrays that define the form elements to the predefined class methods. The library handles all the complex coding behind the scene and creates the pages for you. The package includes a demo plugin that help you walk through necessary features.

**Notes:** this framework does not do anything by itself. If you are not a developer, you do not need this.

= Features =
* **Extensible** - the created admin pages will become highly extensible with the automatically created hooks. In other words, it empowers other developers to customize your plugin or theme. That will result on making your projects grow.
* **Import and Export Options** - buttons that the user can import and export settings by uploading and downloading the text file.
* **Image Upload** - it lets the user easily upload images to the site or the user can choose from existent urls or already uploaded files.

= Supported Field Types =
* Text 
* Password
* Textarea
* Radio Buttons
* Checkboxes
* Dropdown List
* Buttons
* Hidden Fields 
* File Upload 
* Image Upload (Custom File Upload)

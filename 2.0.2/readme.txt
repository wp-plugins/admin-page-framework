Provides simpler means of building administration pages for plugin and theme developers. 

== Description ==
It provides plugin and theme developers with easier means of creating option pages. Extend the library class and pass your arrays that define the form elements to the predefined class methods. The library handles all the complex coding behind the scene and creates the pages and the forms for you. The package includes a demo plugin which helps you walk through necessary features.

**Notes:** this framework does not do anything by itself. If you are not a developer, you do not need this.

= Features =
* **Root Page, Sub Pages, and Tabs** - it allows you to instantly create a top level page and the sub pages of it, plus tabs inside the sub pages.
* **Extensible** - the created admin pages will become highly extensible with the automatically created hooks. In other words, it empowers other developers to customize your plugin or theme. That will result on making your projects grow.
* **Import and Export Options** - buttons that the user can import and export settings by uploading and downloading the text file.
* **Image Upload** - it lets the user easily upload images to the site or the user can choose from existent urls or already uploaded files.
* **Date Picker** - it lets the user easily select dates.
* **Color Picker** - it lets the user easily pick colors.
* **Settings API Implemented** - it uses the [WordPress Settings API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_API) for creating the form so the standard option design will be employed.
* **Validation and Error Messages** - with the pre-defined validation callbacks, the user's submitting data can be verified as a part of using the Settings API. Furthermore, by setting the error array, you can display the error message to the user.
* **Custom Post Types** - the framework provides methods to create custom post types.
* **Meta Boxes** - the framework provides methods to create custom meta boxes with form elements that you define.

== Installation ==

= Getting Started =

**Step 1.** Include **`admin-page-framework.php`** that is located in the **`classes`** folder into your theme or plugin.

`if ( ! class_exists( 'AdminPageFramework' ) )
    include_once( dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/class/admin-page-framework.php' );`
	
**Step 2.** Extend the Library Class.

`class APF_GettingStarted extends AdminPageFramework {
}`

**Step 3.** Define the **setUp()** Method.

`function setUp() {
	$this->setRootMenuPage( 'Settings' );               // specifies to which parent menu to belong.
	$this->addSubMenuPage(
		'My First Page',    // page and menu title
		'myfirstpage' 	// page slug
	); 
}`

**Step 4.** Define methods for hooks.

`function do_myfirstpage() {  // do_ + pageslug	
	?>
	<h3>Say Something</h3>
	<p>This is my first admin page!</p>
	<?php
}`

**Step 5.** Instantiate the Class.

`new APF_GettingStarted;`

= Example Code = 

`<?php
/* Plugin Name: Admin Page Framework - Getting Started */ 

if ( ! class_exists( 'AdminPageFramework' ) )
    include_once( dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/class/admin-page-framework.php' );
    
class APF extends AdminPageFramework {

    function setUp() {
		
    	$this->setRootMenuPage( 'Settings' );	
		$this->addSubMenuPage(
			'My First Page',	// page and menu title
			'myfirstpage'		// page slug
		);
	
    }

    function do_myfirstpage() {  // do_ + pageslug
        ?>
        <h3>Say Something</h3>
        <p>This is my first admin page!</p>
        <?php   
    }
    
}
new APF;
// That's it!`

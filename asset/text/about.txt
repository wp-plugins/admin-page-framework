== New Features ==
<h3>User Meta Fields</h3>

Now you can add custom fields in the user profile page so that each user can store their own options.

![User Meta Fields](%PLUGIN_DIR_URL%/asset/image/new_feature/user_meta_fields.jpg "User Mata Fields")

<h3>Component Generator</h3>
Generate your own version of the framework files by selecting necessary components. This helps reduce the size of the overall framework files you include by excluding certain components.

Also, compared to the minified version which loads all the classes at once, the generated framework uses the auto-loader, which is lighter and improve the load time performance.

        <div class='apfl_cell'>    
            <h3>Framework Loader</h3>

            <p>The plugin is no longer a demo plugin of Admin Page Framework but it serves as a framework loader and make the framework functionality available to the entire site.</p>

            <p>If you choose it to activate this plugin, and let it run in the background, you don't have to manually include the framework file in your plugins or themes.</p>
        </div>

    <div class='apfl_columns_col apfl_col_element_of_3'>
        <div class='apfl_cell'>    
            <h3>Plugin Bootstrap Utility</h3>

            <p>The newly introduced abstract utility class lets you set up loading components including requirement checks upon plugin activation.</p>

            <p>You just extend it and define certain methods and instantiate it. That's it.</p>
        </div>

            <h3>WordPress Readme & MarkDown Parser</h3>

            <p>Now you can use the built-in WordPress readme parser. This is useful when you need to create instruction pages in your plugin/theme.</p>

            <p>You can just write instruction in your readme file and display it.</p>

== Getting Started ==

<h3>Write Your First Plugin</h3>
Let's create a very simple plugin to understand the whole workflow of using Admin Page Framework.

<h3>Step 1 - Get the Files</h3>

![Component Generator](%PLUGIN_DIR_URL%/asset/image/getting_started/my_first_plugin.png "Component Generator")

First, you need to have your own copy of the framework files. 

1. Go to **Dashboard** -> **Admin Page Framework** -> **Tools** -> **[Generator](%WP_ADMIN_URL%/admin.php?page=apfl_tools)**.
2. **(Important!)** Enter your unique prefix. If your plugin is named, let's say "My First Plugin" then you may set the prefix "`MyFirstPlugin_`".
3. Also set the text domain of your project, `my-first-plugin` as an example. This will be used when creating translation files.
4. Download the file by pressing **Download**.
5. If download is successful, you'll get a zip file named `{your text domain-}admin-page-framework.zip`. Extract the contents to your preferred location at your convenience. 
Make sure `admin-page-framework.php`, `admin-page-framework-include-class-list.php` and some other sub-directories are present in the extracted directory.

<h3>Step 2 - Include the Framework</h3>

Now it is time to code. In your code editor, insert your plugin header comment to tell WordPress that it is a plugin.

`
/* Plugin Name: My Plugin */
`

Next, you need to tell PHP to include the framework you just downloaded. The file name to include is `admin-page-framework.php`, the bootstrap script of the framework.

Assuming your class prefix set in the above step is `MyFirstPlugin_`, then your factory class name to extend will be `MyFirstPlugin_AdminPageFramework`. If you have not set the prefix, it will be just `AdminPageFramework`.

So check if that class name has been already loaded. And if not, load it. To load a PHP file, you can use the `include()` PHP function and pass the framework path to it (set your own path there).

`
include( dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/library/admin-page-framework/admin-page-framework.php' );
if ( ! class_exists( 'MyFirstPlugin_AdminPageFramework' ) ) {
    return;
}
`

<h3>Step 3 - Extend the Factory Class</h3>
By extending the framework admin factory class, you can add your own desired functionality on top of it.

`
class MyFirstPlugin extends MyFirstPlugin_AdminPageFramework {

  ... our code comes here ...
   
}
`

<h3>Step 4 - Define the <em>setUp()</em> Method</h3>
Now we need to tell the framework what page to create. 
The factory class already defines certain methods. If you extend the class, your extended class already has those methods.
The `setUp()` method is one of them, and in this method, you set up necessary configurations.

The `setRootMenuPage()` method allows you to set the top-level page and the `addSubMenuItem()` method allows you to add sub-menu pages and links.

Let's add a page to the `Settings` page. You need to decide what pag slug to use. Pick a unique one. Here we use `my_first_page` as an example.

`
public function setUp() {
    $this->setRootMenuPage( 'Settings' ); 
    $this->addSubMenuItem(
        array(
            'title'     => 'My First Page',
            'page_slug' => 'my_first_page',
        )
    ); 
}
`

<h3>Step 5 - Define the Methods for Hooks</h3>
Now you can insert your own output of the page with some of the pre-defined callback methods.

One of them is `do_{page slug}` method. You define a method named like so and it will be automatically gets called.

`
public function do_my_first_page() {
    ?>
    <h3>Say Something</h3>
    <p>This is my first admin page!</p>
    <?php
}
`

<h3>Step 6 - Instantiate the Class</h3>
You need to instantiate the class you defined. When it is instantiated, it will run the internal constructor and takes care of everything needed to create admin pages for you.

`
new MyFirstPlugin;
`

![Plugin Listed](%PLUGIN_DIR_URL%/asset/image/getting_started/my_first_plugin_in_plugin_list_table.png "Plugin Listed")

And your code is now ready to run as a plugin. Compress it in a zip file and upload it to your WordPres site.

<h3>Example Plugin</h3>
**[Download](https://github.com/michaeluno/my-first-plugin/archive/master.zip)**
`
<?php
/* Plugin Name: My First Plugin */ 

// Set your own path here
include( dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/library/admin-page-framework/admin-page-framework.php' );
if ( ! class_exists( 'MyFirstPlugin_AdminPageFramework' ) ) {
    return;
}

class MyFirstPlugin extends MyFirstPlugin_AdminPageFramework {
    
    /**
     * Sets up pages. 
     */
    public function setUp() {
        $this->setRootMenuPage( 'Settings' ); 
        $this->addSubMenuItem(
            array(
                'title'     => 'My First Page',
                'page_slug' => 'my_first_page'
            )
        );
    }
    
    /**
     * Triggered in the middle of rendering the page.
     * 
     * Inserts your custom contents here.
     * 
     * @remark      do_{page slug}
     */
    public function do_my_first_page() {
        ?>
        <h3>Say Something</h3>
        <p>This is my first admin page!</p>
        <?php   
    }

}

new MyFirstPlugin;
`

See it's very short and simple, huh?

There are different types of factory classes for different functionality besides the admin page factory class you just used.

By extending them like just you did, you can create post types, meta boxes, widgets, user meta fields, and taxonomy fields.
